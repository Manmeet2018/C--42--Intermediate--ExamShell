# 42_Exam-C-Intermediate--ExamShell
Repository is used for the prepration of C - Intermediate examshell in 42 School - Silicon Valley.It contains all of the Intermediate Questions and solutions to it.

Solution provided are fully tested and written by me, for some problem's there are more then one solution.

For better understanding pull the work and use debugger(LLDB or GBD) to see how each step works. 
Any suggestion's will be highly appreciated. -_-

## LLDB Basic Working Steps:imp:
1. gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -g 
2. lldb ./a.out -- > Used to go into LLDB mode. 
3. b main --> to set breakpoint
4. r --> run
5. gui ---> Graphic User Interface.
6. use 's' key to go to each next step.

## Steps to clone the work
1. cd ~
2. git clone https://github.com/Manmeet2018/C--Intermediate--Exam--42--.git
3. cd C--Intermediate--Exam--42--.git
4. Search Questions as per level.
5. Located at various directory distinguished by there difficulty levels and see the subject.en.txt to undertsand the question and for solutions see the *.c files and there working.
